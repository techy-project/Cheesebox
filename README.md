# Rebranding
Cheesebox will be rebranded with Rust and will no longer be an Distrobox wrapper. The rebranded name will be Lidbox (**Li**nux **d**istribution **box**). I'm sorry that I didn't make a new release for 0.1.2 when it was planned for it to be released in December 19th of 2024.

You can still use Cheesebox until March 25th of 2025. I removed the instructions how to build it and you can use the executable for portable version.

It will also be available in Windows too!
